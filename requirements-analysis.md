## Client Interview Session Transcript

**Date:** March 10, 2025  
**Client:** Market Romi  
**Participants:**  
- **Development Team:** Romeo, Xhulio, Kevi  
- **Client Representatives:** Client 1 (Owner), Client 2 (Manager)

### Meeting Transcript

**Romeo:** "Thanks for joining us today. Our goal is to better understand your current workflow and identify key challenges so we can build a solution tailored to your needs."

**Client 1:** "The biggest problem we face is managing customer orders. Right now, everything is done manually through phone calls and emails, which is very inefficient."

**Client 2:** "Yes, it's easy to lose track of important details, and it's a challenge to communicate effectively with customers about their orders and the status of deliveries."

**Xhulio:** "Can you walk us through the process when an order is placed?"

**Client 2:** "Typically, a customer will reach out to us via phone or email, we manually input their order into a spreadsheet, check stock, and then process the order. It’s not ideal, especially when dealing with high volumes."

**Kevi:** "Do you currently use any tools to assist with inventory or order management?"

**Client 1:** "We just use spreadsheets for inventory management and simple notes for orders. Nothing integrated, really."

**Romeo:** "What features would you find most valuable in this new system?"

**Client 1:** "A user-friendly online ordering system where customers can place and track orders, view our product catalog, and even communicate directly with us. On our end, a system that helps manage inventory, process orders more quickly, and track sales would be essential."

**Xhulio:** "What do you think would most improve the customer experience?"

**Client 2:** "Having a clearer, more streamlined way for them to place orders and receive updates on their status. It would also be great to allow them to view our inventory before placing an order, so they know exactly what's available."

**Kevi:** "How do you currently communicate with your customers about order status or issues?"

**Client 2:** "Mostly by phone or email, but it’s often inefficient and can lead to delays in response."

**Romeo:** "How many orders does the store typically handle each week?"

**Client 1:** "We handle about 150 to 200 orders weekly, but the volume is steadily increasing, which is why we need a better system."
